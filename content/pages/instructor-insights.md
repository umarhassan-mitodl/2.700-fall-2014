## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _2.700/2.701 Principles of Naval Architecture_ as it was taught by Prof. Joel Harbour and Prof. Themistoklis Sapsis in Fall 2014.

This course is an introduction to principles of naval architecture. 2.700 is the undergraduate version of the course, and 2.701 is the graduate version. Both subjects meet together, but students in the graduate version complete additional assignments and are graded more stringently.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

Upon completion of the course students will have an introductory knowledge of naval ship design and construction, from ship geometry, hydrostatic performance, ship resistance, powering and propulsion along with intact and damage stability.

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

After completing this course, students may continue to take ship design courses in the [2N program](https://2n.mit.edu/).

Graduates go on to become naval architecture engineers and managers in both commercial and government naval ship acquisition programs, new construction and maintenance facilities and research and design centers.

## Curriculum Information

### Prerequisites

Either of these courses satisfy the prerequisite:

- [_2.002 Mechanics and Materials II_](/courses/2-002-mechanics-and-materials-ii-spring-2004)
- [_2.02B Mechanics of Structures_](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m2a.html#2.02B)

### Requirements Satisfied

2.700 can be applied toward a [2-OE degree](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/mechanical-ocean-engineering-course-2-oe/) (Bachelor of Science in Mechanical and Ocean Engineering), but it is not required.

### Offered

Every fall semester.

## Assessment

The students' grades were based on the following activities:

- 40% Assignments and Projects
- 15% Research Paper and Presentation
- 45% Quizzes

## Student Information

### Enrollment

18 students

### Breakdown by Year

A few undergraduates, but primarily graduate students.

### Breakdown by Major

Most students were in the Mechanical Engineering department, which includes ocean engineering. A few students were from the Nuclear Engineering department.

### Typical Student Background

Student backgrounds range from no experience but a general interest in ship design and construction, to commercial and naval ship operators and some design naval ship design experience.

Expected skills include a good understanding of engineering statics, free body diagrams, differential equations, and the ability to utilize computer aided design (CAD) tools.

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### In Class/Lecture

- Met twice per week for 1.5 hours per session; 26 sessions total.
- Quizzes were taken during lecture sessions.

### Recitation

- Met once per week for one hour per session; 11 sessions total.
- Work with computer aided drafting (CAD) tools.
- Review material for quizzes.

### Out of Class

- Work on projects.
- Read and survey naval architecture literature.
- Study for quizzes.
