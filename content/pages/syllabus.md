## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

## Description

This course presents principles of naval architecture, ship geometry, hydrostatics, calculation and drawing of curves of form, intact and damage stability, hull structure strength calculations and ship resistance. It introduces computer-aided naval ship design and analysis tools. Projects include analysis of ship lines drawings, calculation of ship hydrostatic characteristics, analysis of intact and damaged stability, ship model testing, and hull structure strength calculations. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.

## Prerequisites

Students need to have taken one of these courses:

- [*2.002 Mechanics and Materials II*](/courses/2-002-mechanics-and-materials-ii-spring-2004)
- [*2.02B Mechanics of Structures*](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m2a.html#2.02B)
